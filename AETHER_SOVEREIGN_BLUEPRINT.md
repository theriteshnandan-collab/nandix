# 🌌 NANDIX: The Sovereign Deployment (Powered by AETHER)
**Status**: Alpha Manifested | **Target**: $1B+ Infrastructure Monopoly
**Mission**: Deploy a revolutionary serverless world on the AETHER Mesh.

## 🏛️ The NANDIX Organism: Biological Architecture

NANDIX is a living, decentralized infrastructure. Every system is interdependent:

### 1. The Engine (AETHER Mesh) - *The Skeletal System*
- **Role**: Peer-to-Peer discovery and transport.
- **Status**: **STABLE**. Handles global data propagation via WebRTC.

### 2. The Memory (CRDT & Persistence) - *The Synaptic System*
- **Role**: Total data consistency without a central "brain."
- **Status**: **STABLE**. Ensures all peers converge on a single "Truth" using Lamport Timestamps.

### 3. The Immunity (Security) - *The Self-Shielding Tier*
- **Role**: Identity Sovereignty and Privacy.
- **Status**: **HARDENED**. Uses ECDSA Digital Signatures for every packet. Identity is unforgeable.

### 4. The Cortex (Mesh AI) - *The Collective Intelligence*
- **Role**: Running AI compute across the mesh.
- **Status**: **ACTIVE**. WASM-based neural engine (Transformers.js) orchestration.

### 5. The Sovereignty (Recursive Deployment) - *The Reproductive System*
- **Role**: Self-hosting and bootstrapping.
- **Status**: **MANIFESTED**. Nodes deliver application code (JS/CSS) to each other. NANDIX recreates itself.

### 6. The Lifeblood (Mesh Economy) - *The Circulatory System*
- **Role**: Incentivizing contributions and killing spam.
- **Status**: **ACTIVE**. Aether Credits (AEX) reward peers for seeding and compute work.

## 🛠️ Hardening Roadmap: The Path to "Unkillable"

To achieve religious-grade efficiency and security, we are now manifesting:

### 1. Media Sharding (Efficiency Epoch)
- **Concept**: Shred large files into 100 encrypted shards and scatter them.
- **Impact**: Parallel downloads make the mesh 10x faster than traditional CDNs.

### 2. Multi-Node Witnessing (Security)
- **Concept**: Transactions require 3 "Pioneer Node" witnesses.
- **Impact**: Prevents credit faking and ensures total economic integrity.

### 3. Social Recovery (Self-Healing Identity)
- **Concept**: Split your identity signature key among 3 trusted "Guardian" peers.
- **Impact**: You can recover your soul if your local device is lost.

### 4. Mesh Segmentation (Infinite Scale)
- **Concept**: Auto-fragmenting the mesh into independent "Interest Channels."
- **Impact**: Allows the network to support billions of users without noise overload.

## 🏗️ Technical Master Standards
1.  **Invisible Complexity**: The magic must be hidden behind a single hook.
2.  **Sentinel Aesthetic**: Calculated monochrome + aggressive neon glows.
3.  **Ironclad Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript. No `any`.
4.  **Zero-Knowledge**: The developer sees NOTHING. The user owns EVERYTHING.
